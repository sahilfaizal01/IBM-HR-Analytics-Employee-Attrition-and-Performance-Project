# Introduction
Hiring and  retaining employees are complex tasks that require capital, time and skills. Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours  on tasks that do not generate any income such as hiring. Companies spend 15-20% of the employee's salary to recruit a new candidate. An average company loses anywhere between 1% and 2.5% of their total revenue on the time it takes to bring a new hire up to speed. Hiring a new employee costs an average of $7645 (Fortune 500 companies). It takes 52 days on average to fill a position.
